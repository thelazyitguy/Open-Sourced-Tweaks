# ThiccASS

*Where do you get the audio data for your visualizer? I pull it out of my ThiccASS.*

A modified verison of Nepeta's ASS, which is a TCP/IP server to fetch audio buffer's snapshot from mediaserverd.

## Installation

**iOS 11.0-13.3.1 required.**

**This tweak by itself does nothing noticeable. A client tweak is neccessary for visible effects - try [Mitsuha Forever](https://github.com/ConorTheDev/MitsuhaForever/)**

1. Add this repository to Cydia: https://repo.conorthedev.me.
2. Install ThiccASS.

## How to use it in your tweak?

If you send anything to localhost at the port 44333 it will reply with a dump of the current audio buffer (raw PCM audio data). That's all to it.
